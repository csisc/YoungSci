An h-index ranking for Tunisian scientists aged 40 or less based on Google Scholar

## Description
This ranking sorts Tunisian scientists by their Google Scholar h-index. It is released three times per year: 31 December, 30 April, and 31 August. It was created by Houcemeddine Turki from the Data Engineering and Semantics Research Unit, University of Sfax, Tunisia. It is the last part of a series of h-index rankings for Tunisian scientists to study the landscape of Tunisian scholarly research. It sorts scientists by h-index. When the h-index values are equal, results are sorted per their i10-index, then per their 5-year h-index, then per their 5-year i10-index, then per their number of citations, and finally per their number of 5-year citations. People who like to be included are invited to fill out the Google form [here](https://forms.gle/q4eBsgL94cbMHA6w7)
